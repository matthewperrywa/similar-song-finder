# similar-song-finder
Website that gives 30 song recommendations based on 1 entered song.

Utilizes Spotify API to find the entered track and recommend 30 similar songs in the Spotify database.

How to use:

1. Using your Spotify account, login on Spotify's developer website: https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/.
2. Once you are logged in, click "CREATE AN APP".
3. Open the "index.html" file in this repository as a webpage. I use the Live Server extension in VS Code to do this, but you can do this however you prefer.

5. Enter the song and artist that it is by to get similar song recommendations. Click submit. You can click submit again to cycle through more recommendations or you can change the song and artist for recommendations based on other songs.
